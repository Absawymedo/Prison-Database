#Prison Database Project
Welcome to the Prison Database Project! This repository contains the code and resources for a prison management system developed using Jade, Node.js, and SQL Server.

#Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive database system to manage various aspects of a prison, including inmate records, staff information, visitor logs, and more. The system provides an interface for authorized personnel to perform operations such as adding, updating, and querying data related to the prison.

Install the required dependencies by navigating to the project directory and running the following command:

npm install
Configure the database connection by providing the necessary details in the config.js file.

Start the Node.js server by running the command:

npm run watch
Access the application by opening a web browser and visiting http://localhost:3000.

Using ngrok can allow online hosting

#Technologies Used
The Prison Database Project utilizes the following technologies:

Jade (Pug): A high-performance template engine for Node.js and Express used to generate dynamic HTML pages.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows executing JavaScript code outside a web browser.

SQL Server: A relational database management system used to store and manage the prison's data.

Express.js: A flexible and minimalistic web application framework for Node.js used to handle server-side logic and routing.
